### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    I loved lab 4 part 1. In lab 4 part 1 we made a program that can convert a measurement from the metric system to various units in the US customary system. I enjoyed this lab because I am a baker and I use programs like this when baking, so it was nice learning how to make them.

* Lab 5

    I found lab 5 part 1 interesting. In lab 5 part 1 we made a program that can calculate the area of a rectangle. if you input the length and the width of a rectangle the program can find the area of the rectangle

* Lab 8

    I enjoyed lab 8 part 2. One of the reasons I liked this lab is what we are learning in my math class. In this lab, we wrote a program that can calculate the average of the numbers that are given.
